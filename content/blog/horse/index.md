Special thanks to the incredible Dr. Simon Griffin, Professor Fred Leung, and Ms. Grace Lai from the ISF Academy Shuyuan Microbiology Lab for their incredible support and guidance throughout this journey. Also incredibly thankful towards my amazing partner Dionne Daiyin Yeung - without her, this project would not exist as it does today.
