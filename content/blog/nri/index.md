### What is this?
In the summer of 2018, I spent three weeks researching Lugou Bridge's significance in Beijing's history in the Needham Research Institute at Cambridge. I produced a paper titled “How Does Lugou Bridge Reflect the Rise of Beijing as a Political Centre?” that was **published in Bauhinia Volume V** (ISSN 2409-4064), which you can view [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iWOTdm1wuhoXYhW1a0WActiCrwqZwZl9/view?usp=drive_web).
