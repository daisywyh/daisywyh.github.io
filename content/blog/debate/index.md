### What have I done?

#### As an advisor to the school

I helped advise the school's science teams to host a debate for their seventh grade interdisciplinary unit. Through various meetings with faculty, I helped to shape official curriculum for the unit, as well as guidelines for the final debate oriented assessment.

#### As a coach

Every Thursday, I help coach the junior debate team, creating original curriculum and teaching this curriculum to the team.

#### As a member

I've represented the school across various competitions in Hong Kong, consistently placing in the top half of competitions.
