### What did I do?

#### Leadership

I have been **team captain** since 2016, and I've been in charge of recruiting members, communication between the team and school officials for changes in lineups, and working with team members to create the best lineups for each game. Under my leadership, our team has gone from not placing in competitions, to being **routinely top three in Hong Kong**.

#### Mentorship/Coaching

I do my best to coach and mentor the younger team members, not only in badminton skills, but in leadership as well, and giving tips and advice to the younger team captains on how to lead a team effectively.
