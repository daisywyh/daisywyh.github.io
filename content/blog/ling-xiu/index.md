### Key Initiatives
#### Social Media - @isf2021
As grade 11 prefect, I pioneered the use of using social media to connect students with the leadership team, creating an **Instagram page** (@isf2021) for our grade level. As one of the managers of the account, I help **maintain an online presence and brand** for our grade 11 prefect team, helping to brand our position as a good mix between reliable and dependable, as well as relatable and entertaining. We post entertaining memes, and **facilitate student voice** through the use of Instagram polls. Through the pandemic, we've played a key role in facilitating effective communication between students and faculty, leading to restructuring of courses to appropriately reduce workload.

We have managed to achieve **extremely high rates of follower engagement**, regularly achieving around **77% viewer engagement on our stories**, and around **58% viewer engagement on our posts**.

Unfortunately, due to concerns about student privacy, the account is currently private. If you wish to learn more about it, feel free to contact me over email, and I will be more than happy to discuss the details of the account with you.

#### Social Media - @isf_lingxiu
As a member of the Ling Xiu executive team, I lead efforts in establishing an school-wide Ling Xiu Instagram account. This account is currently in the beta-testing phase.

#### ISF's Got Talent
I played a crucial role in organising and hosting the first ISF's Got Talent, helping to organise logistics and judging. Through my efforts, we were able to host a highly successful two hour program. Since then, ISF's Got Talent has become an annual event with great popularity in the ISF community.
