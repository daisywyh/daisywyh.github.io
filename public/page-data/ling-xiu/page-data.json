As one of the managers of the account, I help <strong>maintain an online presence and brand</strong> for our grade 11 prefect team, helping to brand our position as a good mix between reliable and dependable, as well as relatable and entertaining. We post entertaining memes, and <strong>facilitate student voice</strong> through the use of Instagram polls. Through the pandemic, we’ve played a key role in facilitating effective communication between students and faculty, leading to restructuring of courses to appropriately reduce workload.</p>\n<p>We have managed to achieve <strong>extremely high rates of follower engagement</strong>, regularly achieving around <strong>77% viewer engagement on our stories</strong>, and around <strong>58% viewer engagement on our posts</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to concerns about student privacy, the account is currently private. If you wish to learn more about it, feel free to contact me over email, and I will be more than happy to discuss the details of the account with you.</p>\n<h4>Social Media - @isf_lingxiu</h4>\n<p>As a member of the Ling Xiu executive team, I lead efforts in establishing an school-wide Ling Xiu Instagram account. This account is currently in the beta-testing phase.</p>\n<h4>ISF’s Got Talent</h4>\n<p>I played a crucial role in organising and hosting the first ISF’s Got Talent, helping to organise logistics and judging. Through my efforts, we were able to host a highly successful two hour program. Since then, ISF’s Got Talent has become an annual event with great popularity in the ISF community.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ling Xiu (Student Council)","date":"March 07, 2021","description":"I served on my school's student council for two years, where I pioneered and pushed for use of social media to increase student engagement and student voice.","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/30e855ee11b5292e1288220e8f924698/ac53a/IMG_6974.jpg","srcSet":"/static/30e855ee11b5292e1288220e8f924698/722c4/IMG_6974.jpg 340w,\n/static/30e855ee11b5292e1288220e8f924698/1d671/IMG_6974.jpg 680w,\n/static/30e855ee11b5292e1288220e8f924698/ac53a/IMG_6974.jpg 1360w,\n/static/30e855ee11b5292e1288220e8f924698/6eda9/IMG_6974.jpg 2040w,\n/static/30e855ee11b5292e1288220e8f924698/eb7b7/IMG_6974.jpg 2720w,\n/static/30e855ee11b5292e1288220e8f924698/10a43/IMG_6974.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ling-xiu/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/horse/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Equine Gut Microbiome Research"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
